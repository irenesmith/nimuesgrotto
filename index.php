					<h1>Welcome to the Grotto!</h1>
          <p>A funny thing happened on the way to the Winter 2017 Issue.</p>
          <p>
            I had sudden vision problems that made working on the magazine
            nearly impossible. I discovered that I had macular degeneration
            as well as bleeding and swelling in my eyes caused by Type 2
            Diabetes. Over the next three years I went to the doctor every
            few weeks, receiving injections directly into into the left and
            then the right eye. Not fun, believe me.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while, the time between injections increased. The macular
            degeneraton went into remission, the swelling went away, and
            finally the bleeding stopped and cleared up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that I've reached the point where I can see, I'd like to revive
            the Grotto. Because, after all, like Wesley we were not all the way
            dead, we were only mostly dead!
          </p>  
          <p>
            Hopefully Miracle Max can provide the potion we need. What do you
            think?
          </p>
          <p>
            The October 2020 edition will appear here on Halloween night! But
            we can't do it without you! (Yes, I'm looking at you
            #WritingCommunity!) Please take a look at our
            <a href="guidelines.php">Guidelines</a> and then submit! We're
            looking for Speculative Flash Fiction (1,000 words or less) as well
            as short reviews of books and movies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can't wait to hear from you all.
          </p>
