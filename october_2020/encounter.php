					<h1>Encounter</h1>
					<p class="author">by Susan Gravely</p>
          <p>Ed reached for the mic without taking his eyes off the mountain top. Forget it, he thought, no one&rsquo;s going to hear me anyway.</p>

          <p>The plane barely cleared the peak. Just as Ed sighed with relief, a powerful downdraft overcame the airplane&rsquo;s desire to remain airborne.</p>

          <p>Skids touched snow and ice, and the craft became a toboggan with a propeller. Racing downward, Ed prayed for lift, but the air was too thin.</p>

          <p>The yeti saw the plane just before it hit him. Ed saw the yeti at the same moment.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me?&rdquo; were Ed&rsquo;s last words.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Nu-ak grawl hurmf!&rdquo; were the yeti&rsquo;s.</p>
