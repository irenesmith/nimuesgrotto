					<h1>Ghoul</h1>
					<p class="author">by John Governale</p>
					<p>I didn't set out to be a ghoul. If you had asked me, I'm not sure I could have told you what a ghoul is. And I've never been ghoulish. Not into horror films or Goth kind of stuff.</p>
					<p>Until this morning, I was a normal high school girl, concerned about her grades, her complexion, and a date to the prom—not necessarily in that order.</p>
					<p>Now here I am in a cemetery—a graveyard, eek!—about to enjoy a leg of Anderson. That is, if the newly buried person matches the gravestone. I've seen enough NCIS to know that mix-ups happen. If this is not Anderson's grave, then I'm about to enjoy a leg of I don't know who.</p>
					<p>I expect the embalming fluid is going to spoil the taste, but beggars can't be choosers.</p>
					<p>Digging this guy up—let's assume it's Frederick Anderson as advertised—digging him up and breaking into his coffin was not a lot of fun. Given my druthers, (what are druthers, anyway?) given my druthers, I'd rather be at the prom, dancing with some kid with sweaty palms and acne like mine.</p>
					<p>I didn't set out to be a ghoul. Technically, I'm a ghoulette. Or a ghouline. Or a ghoulenista. Whatever.</p>
					<p>If I had to suddenly be undead, why couldn't I have been a vampire. One with skin that sparkles in the sun and the ability to run like the wind. One who gets to bite cute boys in the neck.</p>
					<p>Nope. Ghoul. A girl ghoul. Just my luck. A girl ghoul in a prom dress that now has no resale value.</p>
					<p>I had the dress on—I'd only just bought it—and decided to wear it home. You know, for a laugh. I'd stepped out of the store and was looking around to see if anyone I knew—or even someone I didn't know—was checking me out, when I walked smack into this lady.</p>
					<p>Instead of saying sorry or pardon me or oops, or even nothing at all, I said, "Why don't you watch where you're going, you horrid ghoul."</p>
					<p>I'm never like that. Can you believe I called a complete stranger a horrid ghoul?</p>
					<p>The lady, who was quite lovely, with the sort of skin I'd die for, had piercing green eyes. She smiled at me. I was about to apologize when she grabbed my hand, raised it to her lips, and bit me.</p>
					<p>"Hey!" I said.</p>
					<p>"We'll see who's a horrid ghoul," she said, got into a waiting car, and was driven away.</p>
					<p>Why couldn't I have said watch where you're going, you goddess. Or watch where you're going, you fairy princess. Or watch where you're going, you vampire with sparkly skin.</p>
					<p>No. I called her a horrid ghoul.</p>
					<p>Now here I am in the middle of the night in a graveyard, wearing a prom dress, and about to feast on Frederick Anderson's leg.</p>
					<p>It's a hairy leg. And it smells of formaldehyde.</p>
					<p>But, hey. It's not half bad.</p>
