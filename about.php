					<h1>About the eZine</h1>
					<p>
            Nimue's Grotto is a bi-monthly eZine, publishing flash fiction. Our
            stories are Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Horror. By Flash Fiction,
            we mean stories that are 1,000 words or less in length. If you are
            a writer, please visit our <a href="guidelines.html">Guidelines</a>
            for details.
          </p>

					<p>
            In case you don't know who Nimue is, the Lady of the Lake, the
            ruler of Avalon in Arthurian legend. She is also the one who
            entrapped Merlin in the oak tree. It always made sense to me that
            an eZine named after her would contain stories that enthrall and
            enchant.

					<p>
            Irene P. Smith is a writer, programmer, and web designer who has
            been writing about computers and programming for over 30 years. She
            learned to program in 1983 and that, as they say, was the
            beginning. Irene's first publication was an article about
            programming in the BASIC language in a magazine called
            <cite>CodeWorks</cite>. Soon after, she made a sale to
            <cite>Turbo Technix Magazine</cite> and then became a Contributing
            Editor to <cite>PC Techniques Magazine</cite> edited by Jeff
            Duntemann (check out his story

            In recent years, Irene has been working as a contract Technical
            Writer in various businesses in New York City. In 2013, she
