					<h1>Welcome to the Grotto!</h1>
					<p>So, it is summer, or almost summer, and I am proud to present a new 
					issue of Nimue’s Grotto. </p>
					<p>So what have you been up to since we saw you last? Maybe you are on 
					vacation? Well, we've got some relaxing reading for you in this, our second 
					issue of the Grotto.</p>
					<p>Despite some technical difficulties that have made us a week late, we're 
					getting into the swim of things. We have stories from some new writers and 
					also from some that you might remember from our Spring issue. Tell your friends 
					about us and, if you have the time, send a little feedback our way. We would 
					love to hear from you.</p>
					<p>If you have never visited us before, you can check out our premiere issue 
					from <a href="spring_2017/">Spring, 2017</a> and catch up on what you missed.</p>

					<h1>The Dying</h1>
					<p class="author">by Meredith Loughran</p>
					<p>I am the beginning and the end. No, I'm not talking about anything biblical but the catastrophic event of my birth is nothing short of all the bad parts in the Bible. </p>

					<h1>Meghan's Song</h1>
					<p class="author">by Eliza Tufts</p>

					<h1>Light Always Accelerates</h1>
					<p class="author">by Ken Dushek</p>
					<p>“We don't warp the space-time boundaries to travel through a hole or vortex,” I explained. Her long orange hair covering the top half of her face. She pulls the majority of the blockade behind her ear, but it just splashes back into place a second later.</p>
